Each labeled item, which is more correctly called a *variable*, is a way of attaching a name to a piece of data, and as the term suggests the actual value that is being referred to can change while the remainder of the program remains the same, i.e. we could calculate the density in the same way for different masses and volumes.

    "All the Python objects (items of data) used thus far have been of the standard types. However it is possible to create custom Python objects using the class keyword. This creates a named prototype which connects data values and bound functions (methods) together in an organized way. A class can often be thought of as equivalent to a table in a database. For reasons of brevity this aspect of Python will not be discussed in great detail in this chapter. However, a simple example is provided below which illustrates a rudimentary Person object. The class block contains the definitions of two functions. It defines the `__init__()` method which, because it has a particular name, is run any time an object of that type is created: here its task is to associate the input name and age with `self`; a special variable that represents the run-time object. A second method `get_first_name()` is defined which extracts and passes back the first part of the full name, which was stored as `self.name`. "
