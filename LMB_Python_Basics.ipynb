Each labeled item, which is more correctly called a *variable*, is a way of attaching a name to a piece of data, and as the term suggests the actual value that is being referred to can change while the remainder of the program remains the same, i.e. we could calculate the density in the same way for different masses and volumes.

    "File operations revolve around a file object. This is typically generated using the inbuilt `open()` function, given the location of the data on the file system. Once the file object is created various functions can be used to read and write data; the object is the Python interface to the stored data. In the next example a file object is created, and all of its data read. The use of `'r'` is to specify that the file is opened for reading, though this is the default when not specified. The data may be read in its entirety using `read()`: "

    "All the Python objects (items of data) used thus far have been of the standard types. However it is possible to create custom Python objects using the class keyword. This creates a named prototype which connects data values and bound functions (methods) together in an organized way. A class can often be thought of as equivalent to a table in a database. For reasons of brevity this aspect of Python will not be discussed in great detail in this chapter. However, a simple example is provided below which illustrates a rudimentary Person object. The class block contains the definitions of two functions. It defines the `__init__()` method which, because it has a particular name, is run any time an object of that type is created: here its task is to associate the input name and age with `self`; a special variable that represents the run-time object. A second method `get_first_name()` is defined which extracts and passes back the first part of the full name, which was stored as `self.name`. "

    "As illustrated above, two objects were made using the Person prototype, thus creating two different instances of that class: stored as variables `p1` and `p2`. The methods and simple attributes that were associated with the `self` are available to each instance using the dot syntax, e.g. `p1.name` and `p1.get_first_name()`. Here, the `self` value stated in class definition represents the object stated before the dot, i.e. `p1`, and is not passed via the parentheses."
